pgp-signature,application/pgp-signature,.asc.sig,"PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is an encryption program, and its encryption format which eventually became the OpenPGP standard.<br /><br />Created by Phil Zimmerman in 1991, it got into some legal trouble early on because encryption of this grade was classified as a munition under U.S. law and restricted from export. These laws, while not completely repealed even now, have been considerably liberalized since, and now export of PGP and related software is only restricted when it's being exported to countries such as Iran that are under special sanction. Zimmerman's PGP company was eventually acquired by Network Associates (now McAfee), which eventually rebranded the original command-line-based PGP as ""McAfee E-Business Server"" and sold off all other PGP assets to some PGP developers who formed a new PGP company, which was eventually acquired by Symantec. Meanwhile, the specifications of the file format had been released as the OpenPGP spec and published as an RFC document, making it available for use in other products.<br /><br />GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG, GPG) is a commonly-used encryption tool using PGP format, running on Linux systems.<br /><br />PGP uses a combination of several encryption techniques applied serially, including symmetric-key and public-key cryptography."

h264,video/h264,.h264,"Advanced Video Coding (AVC), also referred to as H.264 or MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC), is a video compression standard based on block-oriented, motion-compensated integer-DCT coding.[1] It is by far the most commonly used format for the recording, compression, and distribution of video content, used by 91% of video industry developers as of September 2019.<br /><br />It supports resolutions up to and including 8K UHD.<br /><br />H.264 is controversial for being patent-encumbered, and hence subject to royalty requirements. In 2013, Cisco is attempting to partially remedy this by producing a freely distributed executable H.264 codec for many platforms for which they have paid the royalty, allowing anybody to download and use it in unmodified form royalty-free. The source code is also openly available, but any altered versions that anybody might create from it would require separate licensing, as would any distribution of the executables other than direct download from Cisco. Thus, the only way to use it as part of a product without additional license fees is to have the product's installer download the executable from Cisco during the install process, rather than including it directly in your own product (whether on disk or downloadable from your site).<br /><br />HEVC (H.265) has been developed as a more efficient successor to this format, but it is also patent-encumbered. Attempts to create a royalty-free alternative include AV1, Daala, VP9, and Thor.<br /><br />The H.264 specification does not, in an extremely strict sense, define a codec which fits into a series of bytes; instead, it describes the stream as fitting into a sequence of frames called ""network abstraction layer units"", which can then be delineated into a raw byte format by the user. The format for putting these into a raw bytestream described by Annex B of the specification apparently is apparently very widely-used."

javascript,text/javascript,.js,"JavaScript (sometimes abbreviated JS) is a scripting language commonly implemented as part of a web browser in order to create enhanced user interfaces and dynamic websites, but also used in other contexts (such as server-side JavaScript).<br /><br />This is not the same as <a href=""/text/x-java-source"">Java</a>. People constantly get confused about that.<br /><br />JavaScript was originally developed at Netscape by Brendan Eich (who later became Mozilla CEO... very briefly), where it was originally called LiveScript while under development, but became JavaScript (with the name licensed from Sun) in order to capitalize on the popularity of Java, though the languages aren't really related (although there are some similarities in syntax). Later, a Microsoft implementation designed to be (more or less) compatible was called JScript, and an attempt at a formally standardized version of the language was published by ECMA as ECMAScript.<br /><br />The node.js runtime environment is (mostly) implemented in JavaScript, as are applications running within it.<br /><br />Due to its status as the only scripting language for browsers, JavaScript skyrocketed in popularity in the 2000's and 2010's and as of 2017 serves as a lingua franca of Web development. Arguably, it is currently the world's most popular programming language (it tops GitHub and StackOverflow currently)."
json,application/json,.json,"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is widely used by web applications, mobile apps, and other programs to communicate between different systems (such as between a client and server). While it is named after JavaScript, there are libraries for many other programming and scripting languages to let them use this format as well. The geospatial format GeoJSON is based on JSON, as is the remote-procedure-call protocol JSON-RPC and the JSON-LD linked-data format. The IBM standard of JSONx is an XML implementation of JSON. I-JSON is a restricted profile of JSON for Internet use. JSON Web Tokens, JSON Web Encryption, and JSON Web Signatures are JSON-based formats for security-related functions."

There's also a compressed variant, called AIFC with the same mimetype.<br /><br />AIFF chunks provide native metadata. In addition, although it is not in the specification, an ID3 chunk is often used to include ID3V2 metadata.<br /><br />It is difficult to trace down official mention of an official mimetype declaration, however you should follow existing guidance which is to assign with audio/aiff and support reading from audio/x-aiff also."

It uses lossy compressed data.<br /><br />MP3 is based in part on work by the Fraunhofer Institute, which held patents in the format. Other companies may also have held patents encumbering its implementation. One of the relevant patents was <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US5812672"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Patent 5,812,672</a>, which expired in September 2015; many other related patents in various countries expired earlier. The final expiration of all relevant patents took until 2017, however, due to some ""submarine patents"" which were kept in the application process for years, extending their expiration dates. A modified version of DCT compression (Discrete cosine transform) is used, a lossy compression method also used in <a href=""/image/jpeg"">JPEG images</a>.<br /><br />ID3 tags are often used to provide metadata in MP3 files, though they aren't part of the MP3 specification."

WAV is used in MS-Windows to store sounds used in applications. It is also used as an archival format for first-generation (master) files, often with a metadata chunk as specified in the Broadcast Wave (BWF) standard.<br /><br />Note a contributor has discovered compatibility issues with browsers and the official type.
